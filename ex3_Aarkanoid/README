Exercise explanations:
1. I created the classes according to the instructions in campus IL and the
instruction given in the moodle.
I divided the project to 3 packages:
main - for the gameManager class that the main class is in.
gameobjects - for all the game objects such as paddle, ball, second paddle...
brick_strategies - for all the strategies of the bricks, each strategy is
implemented in one class or more.

3. I limited the number of behaviors with a different class - if a doubled
behavior is randomly picked, and then one of the strategies is another
doubled behavior, i create an instance of a class that implements 3 strategies
to a single brick. The mentioned class inherits from DoubledStrategy class.

4. If we want to expand the API to create more then 3 behaviors to a single
brick, we can create a new class that implements the number of behaviors needed.
